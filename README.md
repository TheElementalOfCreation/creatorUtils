# creatorUtils
### About

____

Python package of utilities that I have written. Functions partially written by
others have been credited through comments. Provides many useful functions that
accomplish new tasks or provide a shorthand for certain complex functions.

Should work with both Python 3 and Python 2. If you find a bug or issue, please
report it to me so that I can try to fix it.

____

### Installation:

____

Run `{python executable name} setup.py install` from the root directory of the
package, or run `{python executable name} -m pip install git+https://github.com/TheElementalOfCreation/creatorUtils`

____

### Known issues:

____

* Currently missing full pip compatibility. I plan to have it be installable by name rather than by URL.
* As `creatorUtils.crypt.WebSocket` is still a work in progress, some of its features may not work properly. Please check for sections marked as `TODO` or notes on a section before reporting bugs about it.
